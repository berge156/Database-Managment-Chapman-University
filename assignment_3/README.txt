CPSC 408: Database Management - Rene German
Assignment 3 - Database to the Cloud
Partner: Cole Gotelli

In this assignment, we were given he task to generate random data, export it as a CSV, and then rue-load that to a java file which reads the flat csv file, and organizes it into a 3NF database, which is then uploaded to the cloud.

INSTURCTUIONS

Open the Faker.py file on your computer, run the program, or use my already made FakerData.csv file. If you change the file name, you will need to do so in the FileName constructor. Load the file into my java application (run the main file) and then you should have access to parsing the data.

Other than that I have one major issue: My google cloud accound is restricted. For some odd reason, it connects to my database, but it does not uplaod any of the data becuase my account was "restricted". I have contacted google to help me fix this. I could also be totally wrong, and its totallly my fault, but other than that, it should run.

I worked pretty much side by side with Cole Gotelli, and we did each others bug testing.

I gave some of my resources to:

Brandon Fabre
Alex Hammel


If you have any questions, or I monumentally screwed something up, please contact me.
